## Administration
Use the **Admin Login** link in upper right corner to access student requests and to configure drives.

### About your admin password
Admins cannot change a password. JSTOR Labs can change passwords either remotely or if a device is mailed to us.

### Configure drives
The main Admin page will display the devices you have configured from your NUC drive. 

To configure a new drive:

* Use the drive dropdown to choose a device to copy to, then click Select.
* Make selections for which disciplines to include in the drive. You will see an indication of storage. required for the device you are configuring.
* On the next page, enter a name for your device, then click Export.

### Manage student requests
Use the **View Requests** link to see the queue of items students have reqeuested.

Act on a request by selecting print, PDF, or deny. Choose PDF only if you are connected to JSTOR.org and can access the full database.

Once a **pending** item has action taken on it (by clicking either **print**, **pdf** or **deny**), it will become **completed** and be viewable with the completed filter. All items will persist in the list--there is no method for deletion.

You can change the sorted date order of requests by toggling the arrows next to **Requested**. 

##### Sort requests
Use the button to sort by either **Pending** requests, or **Completed** requests.


##### Import a list
If you are acting on student requests on non-networked computers, you may wish to export that list and then import it to your main computer to keep all requests on one device. Connect or transfer the .csv file you exported from the non-networked computer and on your main computer choose **Import.** 

##### Export a list
You may wish to use this option if you are acting on student requests on a non-networked computer. Request lists you modify on the non-networked computer can be exported to a .csv file and then imported to your main machine. Only the items you are currently viewing will be exported (either the pending list or the completed list).
